      <h1>About</h1>


      <p>As a doer, it interests me to discover things around me. Stepping out of comfort-zone has just made it expand.
    Interested in linguistics, philosophy, art, entheogens and IT.
    Painting thoughts… inspired by the existential intelligence, a wider understanding of the mind and surroundings. Breaking the ego’s interpretation and limitation of reality brings divine infinity.  An artwork is not what it is not, a place to draw conscience, feelings and emotions in this quantum world.</p>
